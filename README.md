Image Visualization using CIFAR-10 Dataset
It loads the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow Datasets and displays a few sample images with their labels to explore the dataset and understand its contents.

Text-to-Image Generation using Stable Diffusion
It uses the Stable Diffusion model from the Hugging Face diffusers library to generate high-quality images from text prompts. The model is run on CPU for simplicity and generates unique visuals based on user-defined prompts.

This project bridges the gap between dataset understanding and creative AI-based image generation.
